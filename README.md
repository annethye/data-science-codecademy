# Data Science Practise Projects
This repository contains my solutions to the practise projects provided in the [Data Science Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science) on codecademy.

## Data Science Foundations I: 
### Python Fundamentals for Data Science
#### Python Syntax and Variable Types
#### [Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project](medical_insurance_syntax.py)
> Exploring how each factor in a linear formula based on age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status affects the insurance cost of a patient.

#### Python Functions
#### [Python Functions: Medical Insurance Project](medical_insurance_functions.py)
> Using a function to calculate medical insurance costs from age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.

#### Python Control Flow
#### [Python Control Flow: Medical Insurance Project](medical_insurance_control_flow.py)
> Implementing a medical insurance cost estimation function and conditional control flow to generate cost-reduction advice based on BMI and smoking status.

#### Python Lists
#### [Python Lists: Medical Insurance Estimation Project](medical_insurance_estimation.py)
> Using lists and a cost estimation function to compare estimated and actual medical insurance costs for multiple individuals.

#### [Working with Python Lists: Medical Insurance Costs Project](medical_insurance_cost.py)
> Using lists to store, sort, slice, and analyse medical insurance cost data for multiple patients.

#### Python Loops
#### [Python Loops: Medical Insurance Estimates vs. Costs Project](medical_insurance_estimates_vs_costs.py)
> Using loops and list comprehensions to analyse and compare estimated versus actual medical insurance costs across multiple individuals.

#### Frida Kahlo Cumulative Project
#### [Frida Kahlo Retrospective Project](frida_kahlo.py)
> Using lists and the zip function to organise paintings, dates, and audio tour IDs into a structured master list for a museum exhibition.

#### Python Strings
#### [Python Strings: Medical Insurance Project](medical_insurance_strings.py)
> Cleaning and parsing messy patient records stored as a single string into structured lists, then computing basic summary statistics using loops and string methods.

- coded correspondence

#### Python Dictionaries
[Hurricane Analysis](hurricane_analysis.py)


#### [Python Dictionaries: Medical Insurance Project](.py)
