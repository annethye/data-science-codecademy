# Data Science Practise Projects
This repository contains my solutions to the practise projects provided in the data science track on codecademy.


## Data Science Foundations I: 
### Python Fundamentals for Data Science
#### Python Syntax and Variable Types
#### [Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project](medical_insurance_syntax.py)
> Exploring how each factor in a linear formula based on age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status affects the insurance cost of a patient.

#### Python Functions
#### [Python Functions: Medical Insurance Project](medical_insurance_functions.py)
> Using a function to calculate medical insurance costs from age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.

#### Python Control Flow
#### [Python Control Flow: Medical Insurance Project](medical_insurance_control_flow.py)
> Implementing a medical insurance cost estimation function and conditional control flow to generate cost-reduction advice based on BMI and smoking status.

#### Python Lists
#### [Python Lists: Medical Insurance Estimation Project](medical_insurance_estimation.py)
> Using lists and a cost estimation function to compare estimated and actual medical insurance costs for multiple individuals.

#### [Working with Python Lists: Medical Insurance Costs Project](medical_insurance_cost.py)
> Using lists to store, sort, slice, and analyse medical insurance cost data for multiple patients.

#### Python Loops
#### [Python Loops: Medical Insurance Estimates vs. Costs Project](medical_insurance_estimates_vs_costs.py)
>
